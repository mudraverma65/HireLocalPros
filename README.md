## Performance of HireLocalPros
We are using [Render.com](https://render.com/) to deploy our backend and frontend. Render.com provider free tier to host the application we are currently enrolled in the free tier. Hence, our application is quite slow. Another significant factor behind this is render.com turn off the server when there are no requests comming. Hence, when we open our site after some time it again restart the server and serve the web pages. This is the COLD START problem [8], because of that our application is quite slow.

## Security

Our application is fully secured. We used JWT based authentication to provide advance security to our application. Moreover, we created the protected routes into the frontend as well so, whenever user request the page without login into the system they are automatically redirect to the login page.

## Testing

We performed following testings on our application
* Functional Testing
* Performace Testing
* Regression Testing

However, we can use Automation testing using Cypress or Selenium. We are targetting to complete e2e test using automation tool Cypress in the future.

## Novelty Work

* Created **InterCeptors** to authenticate request before sending into the backend (client/src/services)
* **Protected Routes** (client/src/ProtectedRoutes.js)
